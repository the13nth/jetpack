# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The routine-based launcher is an AI-powered minimal Android launcher that anticipates user needs and generates contextual UI through intent and action-based predictions. The system uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) mechanisms and spatial embedding analysis to understand user activities and behavior patterns, automatically adjusting the interface to nudge users toward their intended goals. The launcher operates on routine-based contexts (morning, afternoon, evening, weekend) with user-defined actions, creating a predictive and adaptive user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set intentions and goals for different routines, so that the AI launcher can understand my objectives and generate appropriate UI to nudge me toward achieving them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses intention settings THEN the system SHALL allow them to define specific goals or intentions for each routine (morning, afternoon, evening, weekend)
2. WHEN the user sets an intention THEN the system SHALL use natural language processing to understand the goal context and associated actions
3. WHEN intentions are saved THEN the system SHALL create embeddings for spatial analysis and store them in the local RAG knowledge base
4. WHEN the user modifies intentions THEN the system SHALL update the embeddings and retrain the prediction model accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to define actions within each routine that align with my intentions, so that the launcher can anticipate my next moves and prepare the appropriate interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user configures routine actions THEN the system SHALL allow them to add actions like "waking up", "running", "work", "relaxation" with associated apps and data sources
2. WHEN actions are defined THEN the system SHALL create semantic embeddings that link actions to user behavior patterns
3. WHEN the user interacts with action-related apps THEN the system SHALL record contextual data including time, location, previous actions, and outcomes
4. WHEN sufficient action data exists THEN the system SHALL use RAG mechanisms to predict likely next actions based on current context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the launcher to use AI to anticipate my next action based on my current routine, past behavior, and contextual factors, so that the most relevant apps and information appear automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the launcher activates THEN the system SHALL analyze current context (time, routine, recent actions, location if available) using spatial embedding analysis
2. WHEN context analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL query the RAG knowledge base to retrieve similar past situations and successful action patterns
3. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL rank potential next actions by probability and relevance to current intentions
4. WHEN the UI is rendered THEN the system SHALL prominently display the top 3-5 predicted actions with associated apps and quick access widgets
5. WHEN predictions are incorrect THEN the system SHALL learn from user corrections and adjust future predictions accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the launcher to generate a minimal, contextual UI that adapts in real-time based on my predicted needs, so that I can accomplish my goals with minimal friction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generates predictions THEN the system SHALL create a minimal UI layout that prioritizes predicted actions and hides irrelevant elements
2. WHEN the user's context changes significantly THEN the system SHALL regenerate the UI within 2 seconds to reflect new predictions
3. WHEN multiple actions have similar prediction scores THEN the system SHALL display them in an intelligent grouping that allows quick selection
4. WHEN the user consistently ignores certain predictions THEN the system SHALL reduce their prominence in future UI generations
5. WHEN the user is in a flow state (rapid sequential actions) THEN the system SHALL maintain UI stability to avoid disruption

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to learn from my behavior patterns and continuously improve its predictions, so that the launcher becomes more accurate and helpful over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user performs actions THEN the system SHALL record detailed behavioral data including sequence patterns, timing, context, and outcomes
2. WHEN sufficient data is collected THEN the system SHALL use machine learning to identify behavioral patterns and update the spatial embedding model
3. WHEN new patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL incorporate them into the RAG knowledge base for future predictions
4. WHEN the user provides explicit feedback (likes/dislikes predictions) THEN the system SHALL use this as training data to improve accuracy
5. WHEN prediction accuracy falls below 70% THEN the system SHALL trigger a model retraining process

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the launcher to understand temporal and contextual relationships between my actions, so that it can make sophisticated predictions about my workflow and routine variations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing user behavior THEN the system SHALL identify temporal patterns (time-based sequences, duration patterns, frequency cycles)
2. WHEN building the knowledge base THEN the system SHALL store contextual relationships between actions, including prerequisites, dependencies, and typical sequences
3. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL consider both immediate context and longer-term behavioral trends
4. WHEN unusual patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL adapt predictions while maintaining core routine understanding
5. WHEN the user breaks from routine THEN the system SHALL learn these variations as potential new patterns rather than anomalies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the launcher to provide intelligent nudges and suggestions that help me stay focused on my intentions, so that I can maintain productivity and achieve my goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user deviates from intention-aligned actions THEN the system SHALL provide gentle nudges toward goal-supporting activities
2. WHEN the user is procrastinating or distracted THEN the system SHALL surface apps and actions that align with their stated intentions
3. WHEN the user completes intention-related actions THEN the system SHALL provide positive reinforcement and suggest logical next steps
4. WHEN the user consistently ignores nudges THEN the system SHALL adjust its approach and reduce intervention frequency
5. WHEN goals are achieved THEN the system SHALL learn successful patterns and apply them to similar future intentions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents that the AI can analyze to automatically set intentions and generate relevant UI, so that my launcher adapts to my projects, studies, or personal goals without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user uploads a document THEN the system SHALL accept various formats including PDF, TXT, DOCX, and MD files
2. WHEN a document is processed THEN the system SHALL use natural language processing to extract key themes, goals, tasks, and contextual information
3. WHEN analyzing a project requirements document THEN the system SHALL automatically generate intentions related to project milestones, deadlines, and required activities
4. WHEN analyzing personal documents (like religious texts, study materials, or guides) THEN the system SHALL identify relevant practices, schedules, and supportive actions
5. WHEN intentions are auto-generated from documents THEN the system SHALL present them to the user for review and approval before activation
6. WHEN document-based intentions are active THEN the system SHALL surface relevant apps, tools, and information that support the document's objectives
7. WHEN the user interacts with document-related suggestions THEN the system SHALL learn which interpretations are most helpful and refine future document analysis

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the launcher to create dynamic action plans based on uploaded documents, so that my daily routines automatically align with my project requirements or personal study goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project document is analyzed THEN the system SHALL generate a timeline of actions and milestones based on deadlines and requirements
2. WHEN a study document is processed THEN the system SHALL create learning schedules and suggest relevant educational apps and resources
3. WHEN religious or philosophical texts are uploaded THEN the system SHALL identify daily practices, reading schedules, and reflection activities
4. WHEN document-based plans are generated THEN the system SHALL integrate them into existing routines without disrupting established patterns
5. WHEN plans need updates THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust based on progress tracking and changing document context
6. WHEN multiple documents are active THEN the system SHALL intelligently balance and prioritize competing intentions based on urgency and user behavior

### Requirement 10
